# Contribution workflow

First, you will need familiarity with **GitHub Issues** and **Pull Requests**. When you are ready to start working on a feature, you should fork this repository into your account. Follow this [these instructions](https://github.com/Kukuza/p2p-ramp/blob/dev/README.md) to set up your local environment.

1. Before starting to implement features, please ensure that there is an [existing issue](https://github.com/Kukuza/p2p-ramp/issues). You can also [open a new issue](https://github.com/Kukuza/p2p-ramp/issues/new) and propose changes. We recommend that you comment on an issue you are working on to keep everyone updated.

2. In your local environment, branch out from the `dev` branch. Your branches should be prefixed with `feature/` for features or `docs/` for documentation changes. All changes made should be part of a branch and submitted as a pull request. 
   
3. When making commits, we recommend you provide thoughtful message and keep them small for easy reviews.
   
4.  Once your changes are ready, push to your repository and submit your branch as a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). Within a few days, a team member will start a review process. Your PR should be descriptive with a structure like:

- **What** changes or features are in your PR.
- **How** have the changes been implemented
- **Screenshots** that shows components you've created.
  
All our PRs will go through a review process. We, therefore, recommend that you self-review to ensure that your code runs before requesting a review.
